What is this post about?  This is a guide for aspiring programmers to start learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  This guide is the one I wish I had six months ago, back when started learning Ruby from zero programming experience.

But this isn't about me. It's about the tools I wish I knew about from the very beginning.

Before we start.  If at anytime you ever get feel.. Never hesitate to ask for help, it's free after all.  Here are some of a programmers best help resources:
https://www.google.com/ - Yes, you'll be best friends.

QA sites, forums and programming documentation to help solve our Ruby woes.  These are just examples, there are literally hundreds

PART 1 - THE BASICS

This guide assumes you know about the internet.  You know, the one with all the funny cats and animated gifs?  If you're competent enough to connect your home wifi router to the rest of the world, congratulations, you are competent enough to be a programmer... Here's how to get started.

Start with interactive browser lessons that introduce the basics of Ruby.  They are fun and simple ways to learn the syntax and behavior of programming.  Did I mention they're fun?

http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer

Then get oldschool.. by reading a book.  As is sometimes the case, two  can help you learn more.  A good nugget of advice a professional Rails developer once told me is to, "Learn about as many ways to do things as you can, because no one has it all right."  And for the most part so far, I find that to be true.  The more sources you count as learning opportunities, the more you will understand about programming web apps and writing software.

Two books to get started.

When you're on your second wind, stretch your grasp of the language with mind challenging tutorials.  These force you to program on your own a bit, and that's one of the best ways to activate the ruby knowledge found in books.

At some point, say hello to Rails.

http://ruby.railstutorial.org/
http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/
https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial

By this point, you might feel good about this whole programming language gig.  But really, a whole new world awaits.


PART 2 - GETTING OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD

Unless you're a supergenius or future person, you'll likely need help bringing your Ruby and Ruby on Rails skillset to a level you feel comfortable.  This means you must invest time, effort and money into learning how to build what you want to build.  But don't worry, if you're still around at this point in your journey, here begins the fun part.

Meetups.  If you're lucky enough to have Ruby / Rails / General Programming communities nearby, chances are they happen to go outside every once in a while.  Go to these, as you'll be sure to enjoy it.  You will meet real programmers who speak in depth about their work.  There are many groups dedicated to training new developers.  Hackathons are organized, recruiting events.  Even online meetups are available!

Schmoozing is great, but once the meetup ends, you have to go back to your computers.  Try online classes.  They develop your skills over courses designed to introduce new concepts with minimal confusion.  I just completed a course at Tealeaf Academy.  They've truly sharpened much of what I'd learned on my own, and made me feel confident that this is something I can do.

This is as far as my guide goes for now.
